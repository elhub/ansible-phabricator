- CentOS 7.3 has one Configuration Issue: it says that APC is not installed. This may be caused by the particular version of PHP. Since APC is "only" performance related, it should not be a major bug. It is likely that CentOS 8 will solve it.

- Debian 8.7 has a Configuration Issue, when using http rather than https, "Mangled Webserver Response". cause is unknown, may have just been test environment.
			
- Ubuntu 16.04 overall completed.
